### C# and Ruby Class Comparisons

#### Defining
  ##### C#
  > In C# a class is defined by providing the acess modifier (public, private, protected, static, internal, or protected) internal), the word "class" and then the name of the class. Example below.
    
~~~~c#

using System;

namespace ProgrammingGuide
{
  // Class definition.
    public class CustomClass
    {
      // Class members.
      // Class Methods
    }
}
~~~~

  #### Ruby
  > In Ruby a class is defined by the word "class" and followed by the class name, then "end" after all the methods are written. Example below.
  
```ruby

# dog.rb  
# define class Dog  
class Dog  
  # Class Variables
  # Class Methods
end  

```
